# GroupCardGameProject
GROUP! is a card game. Each card has some number of shapes on it. There are 4 attributes per card: 
• number (1, 2, or 3) 
• shape (diamond, squiggle, or oval)
• color (green, blue, or purple)
• shading (empty, striped, solid)solid). 

A group is determined if 3 cards all match in one attribute (eg. all cards have 1) or if each card has a unique attribute (eg. the 3 cards have numbers 1 2 and 3)

If these conditions are not met then a group cannot be formed, a function determines that at the end.

A class is used to define a card and another class is used to define the deck of cards.

Unit tests are run as well to check whether the code is functional through the test file.
